To find the descriptions of each memory address in the microcontroller, look for the "memory map" in the data sheet.

Address 0x0000.0000 -> 0x0003.FFFF means 256kb of memory

To make LED blink, we need to find GPIO F, it is on 0x40025000, go there in the memory.

If it is blank (all "-" or "cdcd"), means it is switched off to save power, this is common practice called clock gating.

To turn memory block on, search data sheet for "clock gating"
